When the Winged Hussars arrive

A cry for help in time of need await relief from Holy League
60 days of siege outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

And the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Let the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Desperation
Desperation
It's a desperate race against the mine
And a race against time

And the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Let the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide
Cannonballs are coming down from the sky
Janissaries are you ready to die
We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye

You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate
On this field you're only facing our hate
But back home the sultan's sealing your fate

We remember
In September
That's the night Vienna was freed
We made the enemies bleed

And the Winged Hussars arrived!
(Storm clouds fire and steel
Death fromabove made the enemy kneel
)Coming down the mountainside
(Fighting power and grace
Death fromabove it's an army ofwings)
Then the Winged Hussars arrived
(Storm clouds fire and steel
Death from above made the enemy kneel)
Coming down they turned the tide
(Fighting power and grace
Death from above it's an army of wings)

We remember
In September
When the Winged Hussars arrived
