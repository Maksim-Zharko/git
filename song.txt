When the Winged Hussars arrive

A cry for help in time of need await relief from Holy League
60 days of siege outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

And the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Let the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Desperation
Desperation
It's a desperate race against the mine
And a race against time

And the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Let the Winged Hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide
